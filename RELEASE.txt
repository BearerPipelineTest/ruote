= OpenWFEru (Ruote) 0.9.18 released

OpenWFEru is an open source workflow / BPM engine implemented in Ruby.

download :  http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=2609


== What's new

The gems have been renamed "ruote" and "ruote-extras". The require paths have not changed.

This name is shorter, easier to spell and serves as a handy prefix for subprojects like "ruote-web" and "ruote-rest".

The source of all the Ruote projects (and the Rufus ones) has moved from RubyForge subversion to GitHub [1], feel free to fork.

This new "ruote" uses threads in a more economic way. This adaptation was driven by deployments on JRuby 1.1.1 which exposed flaws in the way threads were used by OpenWFEru. Ruote now runs happily on Ruby 1.8.6 and JRuby 1.1.1.

There is a new "step" expression [2], spaghetti processes are now easier to script (it's OK as "ruote" is the name of a pasta variety).

This "step" expression is heavily involved in a new sub-project named "ruote-transition" [3][4]. It's a kind of translator that turns XPDL and YAWL process definitions to the Ruote process definition language.

Another addition to the "ruote" family is "ruote-rest" [5], a RESTful workflow / BPM system based on OpenWFEru and the Sinatra [6].
