= ruote testing

running all the tests

  $ ruby19 test/test.rb

running a specific test

  $ ruby19 test/functional/ft_1_process_status.rb

running a test with the EventMachine queue :

  $ ruby19 test/functional/ft_1_process_status.rb -- --em

running a test with file persistence :

  $ ruby19 test/functional/eft_2_sequence.rb -- --fs

running a test with file persistence (but no cache) :

  $ ruby19 test/functional/eft_2_sequence.rb -- --fs -C


== note

Some of the functional tests rely too heavily on proper timing. They may thus fail, especially there's too much activity from other processes.

A trick is to prefix running the tests with "sudo nice -5" (Thanks Torsten).

Of course, it would be nicer if tests would run properly, all the time. Don't hesitate to drop me a line on the mailing list about the ones that fail consistently for you.
